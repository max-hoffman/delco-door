# delco-door
This is a Go server that uses Twilio to let authorized users into my apartment, ranther than having to manually answer my phone and let them in. Strategy inspired by Francesc Campoy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTd3hHUy9OU.

# password

# changing password (in progress)
The password for the door is public and can be changed with a "king of the hill" type Ethereum smart contract. In non-technical terms, people can outbid each other to change the password, until the end of the semester when the change price is set back to zero.
