# delco-door
This is a Go server that uses Twilio to let authorized users into my apartment, ranther than having to manually answer my phone and let them in.

The password for the door can be publicly changed by anyone with and @wustl medical school email with a "king of the hill" type Ethereum smart contract. In non-technical terms, people can outbid each other to change the password, until the end of the semester when the change price is set back to zero.
